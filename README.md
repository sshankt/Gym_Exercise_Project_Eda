Welcome to my **Fitness Data Analysis** project!  
As an aspiring **Data Analyst**, I explored real-world gym and fitness data to uncover insights that can help improve workout plans, fitness apps, and overall user experience.

## 🔍 Objective

To analyze user fitness behavior and generate data-driven insights that can lead to:

- **Males** slightly burn more calories than females.

### ✅ Workout Type
- **Cardio** leads in calories burned.
- **Yoga** shows consistent but lower calorie burn.

### ✅ Experience Level
- **Experts** train longer and more efficiently.
- **Beginners** need structured, guided plans.

### ✅ BMI & Body Fat %
- Higher BMI and fat % = more calories burned.
- Plans should be **customized by body profile**.

### ✅ Frequency & Duration
- **4–6 sessions/week** with **longer durations** yield better results.
- **Consistency is key** to fitness success.
